# Rails Project

Let me start with another confession. This project scared the hell out of me. I use the past tense in the last sentence with a bit of trepidation. As I move into this stage of my web development learning journey, I am experiencing the [imposture syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) with an intensity I can't characterize in words.

I want to talk about my procedure in completing this project. I started with the obligatory attendance of all and every "project prep" study-group available. What I found most terrifying was the statement that my evaluator would be deciding whether or not they would hire me as a entry-level web developer.

I feel like a beginner skydiver stepping up to the open door of a perfectly good airplane out of which I was about to jump. Standing on the fulcrum point between safety and certain death I think, "maybe I should review the parachute packing lab!"

Am I _hire-able_ as a web developer? Will my evaluator think so? I would like to stand out from the rest. I know that I am in a position, like a job applicant, that my work and qualifications are being compared to that of others.

I know I am including too many analogies. However, I have to say that in this instance, I feel a bit like Madonna's new boyfriend in the bedroom. I really don't know how to make this new and interesting for them.
